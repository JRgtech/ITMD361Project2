  <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
  <p>This site is a work in progress. I am learning how to create web pages using HTML5 markup.</p>
  <p>So far, I've been learning a great deal and I am enjoying this class.</p>
  <p>The first part of this project is to create three pages with navigation links.</p>
  <p>One of the pages must be your resume. The other page can contain any media.</p>
  <p>I've decided to include a world map. I would like to list the trips that I would like to take.</p>
  <p>One of my goals this upcoming summer is to get my motorcycle license. I would like to learn how to ride.</p>
  <p>Once I achive my goal, this would be the motorcycle I would like to own.</p>
