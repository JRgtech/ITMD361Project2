  <h1>Places I would like to visit</h1>
  <p>I've took my first trip to a different city in 2016. I went to Houston, Texas.
    I left on a Friday afternoon after work. I took the blue line to O'Hare airport and
    I waited for my flight departure time. This was the first time I flew and it was a great
    experience that motivated me to consider traveling. Here is a list of the cities I would like to visit.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Paris, France</li>
    <li>London, England</li>
    <li>Madrid, Spain</li>
    <li>Tokyo, Japan</li>
    <li>Sydney, Australia</li>
    <li>Los Angeles, California, USA</li>
    <li>Austin, Texas, USA</li>
    <li>New York City, New York, USA</li>
    <li>Seattle, Washington, USA</li>
  </ul>
